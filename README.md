Timer App ⏱️
Just a small practice project! 😄 I was feeling bored during my college lunch break, so I whipped this up. Set your timers and track your tasks in style. Quick, fun, and built in just 2 hours! 

🖥️ Features
Set a Timer: Allows users to set hours, minutes, and seconds for a countdown.
Real-Time Countdown: Displays the remaining time with smooth transitions and accurate time formatting.
Pause/Resume: Users can pause and resume the timer at any point.
Exit Functionality: A simple exit button that takes users back to the homepage.
Neon-inspired UI: A modern and visually appealing interface powered by Tailwind CSS, with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations.

🚀 Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and managing state.
Tailwind CSS: For styling the app with a responsive and modern design.
React Router: For navigation between the input and display pages.
JavaScript: To handle the logic for timer updates and user interactions.
